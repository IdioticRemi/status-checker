# Discord Bot: Status Checker!

### How do I setup the bot?

- First do `npm install` or `yarn` depending on what you're using (use **npm** if not sure)
- Change values inside `config.ts` to your linking.

##### Then you have two solutions:

###### 1) Build for production

- Run either `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- It will create a "dist" folder with the compiled code.
- Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the compiled code!

###### 2) Run development code

- Run either `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
- It will compile and run the code instatly so that's all really! 😉

#### Notes:

- Feel free to create commands/events as you need on the bot, check the few already inside the bot. It works well!
- Don't take credits for this bot or I might sue you 👀
- Also take a look at the LICENSE while you're at it ✨
- Have a nice day fella!

### I hope you enjoy this small discord bot 💕

I'd be very pleased if you could ⭐ the bot!

Thank you!!
